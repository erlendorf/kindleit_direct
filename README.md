# Post webpage to kindle directly by using kindleit

1. Direct post to Kindle
If you push the button, current tab's web page is sent to kindle automatically.

2. Asynchronous send and notification
My extension send web page asynchronous, so it does not prevent your operation.
And, if happens success or failed sending to kindle, it will show notification.

3. contextMenus
In order to push kindle more easily, I add contextMenu function that send kindleit.
you can post anywhere.
